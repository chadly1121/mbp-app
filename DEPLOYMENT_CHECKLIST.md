# MBP App Deployment Checklist ✅

## ✅ COMPLETED FIXES
All major issues have been resolved in this Lovable project:

### 1. Environment Security ✅
- ✅ Created `.env.example` with placeholder values (`<REPLACE>`)
- ⚠️ **MANUAL STEP**: Add `.env` to `.gitignore` (file is read-only in Lovable)
- ⚠️ **MANUAL STEP**: Remove `.env` from git tracking: `git rm --cached .env`

### 2. React/Vite Setup ✅
- ✅ Updated `vite.config.ts` to use only `@vitejs/plugin-react`
- ✅ Added React deduplication: `resolve: { dedupe: ['react','react-dom'] }`
- ✅ Maintained essential Lovable plugins (componentTagger)
- ✅ Kept required server config and path aliases

### 3. Routing & Error Handling ✅
- ✅ Updated `nginx.conf` with proper SPA fallback: `try_files $uri /index.html;`
- ✅ App.tsx already has catch-all 404 route: `<Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />`
- ✅ Error boundary is in place to prevent white screens
- ✅ Lazy loading implemented for better performance

### 4. Package Manager ✅
- ✅ Created `.nvmrc` with Node v20
- ✅ Removed `bun.lockb` 
- ✅ Added comprehensive test scripts to `package.json`

### 5. GitHub CI/CD ✅
- ✅ Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with proper npm workflow
- ✅ Uses `.nvmrc` for Node version
- ✅ Includes build verification step
- ✅ Dependabot configured for weekly npm updates

### 6. Security Headers ✅
- ✅ Enhanced `nginx.conf` with comprehensive security headers:
  - CSP (Content Security Policy)
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-Content-Type-Options  
  - Referrer-Policy
  - HSTS (Strict-Transport-Security)

### 7. Testing ✅
- ✅ Playwright smoke test exists and validates app loading
- ✅ Tests for both main page and 404 handling
- ✅ Added comprehensive test scripts to package.json

### 8. Developer Experience ✅
- ✅ All required scripts in `package.json`: `dev`, `build`, `preview`, `lint`, `test`
- ✅ Added additional useful scripts: `test:unit`, `test:e2e`, `test:watch`

## 🚨 MANUAL STEPS REQUIRED

Due to Lovable's read-only restrictions, you need to manually:

1. **Update .gitignore** - Add these lines:
   ```
   # Environment files
   .env
   *.env.local
   .env.*.local
   
   # Build artifacts
   coverage/
   .nyc_output/
   ```

2. **Remove .env from git tracking**:
   ```bash
   git rm --cached .env
   cp .env .env.local  # backup
   # Edit .env.example to replace actual values with <REPLACE>
   ```

## 🎯 VERIFICATION COMMANDS

After syncing to GitHub, verify everything works:

```bash
# Local development
npm run dev          # Should start on localhost:8080

# Build verification  
npm run build        # Should build without errors
npm run preview      # Should serve the built app

# Testing
npm run lint         # Should pass linting
npm run test         # Should run both unit and e2e tests

# Docker deployment
docker build -t mbp-app .
docker run -p 80:80 mbp-app  # Should serve via nginx
```

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT READY

The app is now configured to:
- ✅ Start with `npm run dev`
- ✅ Build with `npm run build` 
- ✅ Run correctly under Docker + nginx
- ✅ Pass CI pipeline
- ✅ Show no blank screens (error boundary + 404 handling)
- ✅ Follow security best practices

Just complete the manual .gitignore/.env steps and you're ready to deploy! 🎉
